<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This repo consists of an assortment of Python projects I have developed throughout my time in the Generation USA Jr. Cloud Practitioner
bootcamp and the Google Cloud Fellowship. Some of the projects were assignments for class and others were a way for me to reinforce my 
learning with personal projects.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

1. dictionary.py - This project defines 3 seperate dictionarys and then merges the the contents of all 3 into a new 4th dictionary.
2. loop-de-loop.py - This project shows how to iterate over a given number range while excluding definied integers.
3. math-calculation.py - This project shows how to utilize the "math" library to execute calculations.
4. paycheck-calculator.py - This project shows how to setup a function to gather user input and store it in a variable to produce various outcomes.
5. salary-expectation.py - This project captures the user's information to produce an estimated salary expectation based on input varibles.
6. tax-calculatory.py - This project allows the user to calculate their "ACME Corporation" paycheck based on user input.
7. weather-app.py - This project displays the Date & Temperature based on variables.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/iqtheengineer/python-project/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
